# Assignment 4 :TurtleBot3 (Sim2Real) With RealWorld TB3
**Authors:** Rahul Chamarthi, Ravi Varikuti, and Benjamin I Johnson  

## Description:

## TASK-1
The ROS package [assignment4](https://github.com/rahulchamarthi/AuE8230Spring24_Group1/tree/master/assignment4) for this assignment contains the following Python  scripts:

- [circle.py](https://github.com/rahulchamarthi/AuE8230Spring24_Group1/blob/master/assignment4/scripts/circle.py): This script allows the Turtlebot3 burger to move in a circle with a constant twist for a specified distance in the Real world.
- [square.py](https://github.com/rahulchamarthi/AuE8230Spring24_Group1/blob/master/assignment4/scripts/square.py): This script allows the Turtlebot3 burger to move in a square with a constant twist for a specified distance with varying speeds in the Real world.
## TASK-2
- Using [ROBOTIS e-manual](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/slam_simulation/),we have implemented the gmapping and hector mapping in the gazebo.
- Using the maps saved from both algorithms, we have implemented the autonomous navigation package to move the turtlebot3 toward its goal in the real world.
- A comparison of sim2real was outlined in [Assignment4](https://github.com/rahulchamarthi/AuE8230Spring24_Group1/blob/master/assignment4/assignment4.ppt)
