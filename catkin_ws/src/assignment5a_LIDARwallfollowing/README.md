# Assignment 5a: Wall Following

This is our README for the first part of Assignment 5: 5a

## What this Implements 

In this python file we implement code in which the Robot extracts scan data, moves forward at constant velocity, and attempts to avoid a wall. 

More specifically in order to achieve this objective we implemented a simple P controller.  


## Instructions to Run
