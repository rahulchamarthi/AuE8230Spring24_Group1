# Assignment 5b: Obstacle Avoidance

This is our README for the second part of Assignment 5: 5b. 

## What this Implements 

In this python file we implement code in which the Robot extracts scan data, and utilizes it to try to avoid obstacles. 

In our implementation method we did not divide the data into sectors, and immediately saw negative performance. As a result, in our final project we will definitely be segmenting the scan data. 


## Instructions to Run 

```python
roslaunch assignment5b_obstacleavoidance obstacleavoidance.launch
